# WEBGL 2019

This is something I am learning before the year ends with less than 6 hours can I do it?

## Completed (kinda)

Well as it turns out following the guide wasn't too hard. I managed to get from one end to the other in a couple of hours.

I deliberately changed a few things around to cement the ideas in my head. I'm definitely not an expert in the topic but at least I have found a foot hold in the WebGL place.
